# Causally Consistent Replication
Simulator to build and test causal consistency algorithms.

# TODO - Simulator:
- [ ] Client simulation
  - [X] Configuration - Reading values from config file
  - [X] Operations being sent in a closed loop
  - [X] Distinction between read/write operations
  - [ ] Access specific keys to prepare for partial replication
- [X] Configuration - Create an easy-to-read sample config file
- [ ] Metrics
  - [X] Latency
  - [X] Operations/s
  - [ ] Visibility Times
- [X] Heap / Scheduler change - A node can only receive one operation on a specific timestamp. 
- [ ] Transport - Latency Matrix / Throughput into consideration
  - [X] Read and process latency matrices to a format acceptable for Peersim
  - [X] Generate an "optimized" tree graph based on it - Python Script (altered Prim algorithm basically)
  - [X] Import the matrices into Peersim, the Latency ones using E2ENetwork/E2ETransport, and the Tree Overlay using WireFromFile. 
  - [ ] Node Throughput Support
- [ ] Protocol - Base Meta-protocol
    - [X] Internal event queue for non processed events
    - [X] Changes to account for difference between reads/writes
    - [X] Base protocolMessage container class getSize() for Transport etc...
    - [ ] Partial Replication support
- [X] Operation propagation through the system
  - [X] AllToAll Broadcast and Overlay Init - 1 Click
  - [X] Saturn Tree Propagation

# TODO - Protocols
- [ ] C3
- [X] Saturn

# Running the Simulator:
*Compile:* ```mvn clean compile assembly:single```

*Command:* ```java -cp target/peersim.jar peersim.Simulator config/config.txt```
