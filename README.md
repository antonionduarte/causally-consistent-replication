# Causally Consistent Replication
Simulator to build and test causal consistency algorithms.

# TODO - Simulator:
- [ ] **Client simulation**
  - [X] Configuration - Reading values from config file
  - [X] Operations being sent in a closed loop
  - [X] Distinction between read/write operations
  - [ ] Individual Clients
  - [ ] Access specific keys to prepare for partial replication
- [X] **Configuration** - Create an easy-to-read sample config file
- [X] **Collecting Metrics**
  - [X] Latency
  - [X] Operations/s
  - [X] Visibility Times
- [X] **Heap / Scheduler change** - A node can only receive one operation on a specific timestamp. 
- [ ] **Transport - Latency Matrix** / Throughput into consideration
  - [X] Read and process latency matrices to a format acceptable for Peersim
  - [X] Generate an "optimized" tree graph based on it - Python Script (altered Prim algorithm basically)
  - [X] Import the matrices into Peersim, the Latency ones using E2ENetwork/E2ETransport, and the Tree Overlay using WireFromFile. 
  - [ ] Node Bandwidth Support
- [ ] Protocol - **Base Meta-protocol**
    - [X] Internal event queue for non processed events
    - [X] Changes to account for difference between reads/writes
    - [X] Base protocolMessage container class getSize() for Transport etc...
    - [X] New layer to add message processing time support instead of being done through the Heap
    - [X] **Partial Replication** support
      - [X] Each node includes the list of Partitions of every node.
      - [X] Operation propagation according to Partitions
      - [X] Reads / Writes accessing correct partition
      - [X] Migrations
- [X] **Operation propagation** through the system
  - [X] AllToAll Broadcast and Overlay Init - 1 Click
  - [X] Saturn Tree Propagation

# TODO - Protocols
- [X] **C3**
- [X] **Saturn**
- [ ] **Cure or Gentlerain**

# Running and Compiling the Simulator:
**Compile:** ```mvn compile assembly:single```

**Run:** ```java -cp target/peersim.jar peersim.Simulator config/config.txt```
