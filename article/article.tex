\begin{abstract}
Causal replication is a weak consistency model, that works by 
tracking causal dependencies between operations of a system, and making sure that they are propagated
and displayed, to users of that system, in a causally consistent order.
Many different ways of achieving causal consistency have been proposed in the literature
over the years, (eg. usage of Logical Clocks\cite{baquero2016logical}, 
Logical Clocks with Physical Timestamps\cite{roohitavaf2017causalspartan,du2014gentlerain}, tracking Direct Dependencies\cite{lloyd2011don}, 
	usage of specific node topologies that naturally ensure consistency\cite{van2020intrinsic})
but each comes with it's own set of trade-offs which turn the decision complicated 
and	highly dependent on the specification of the system that one is looking to develop. The aim of this work, is 
exploring those trade-offs through the usage of a simulator, to more thoroughly understand the limits,
and optimal use cases of each proposed solution.
